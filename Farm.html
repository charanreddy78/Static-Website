        <p class="p-2 m-3 ">Agriculture tools have an important role in every farmer’s life as these tools provide efficiency, productivity and other benefits. It also helps in improving soil health and precision farming. We can say agriculture tools are the backbone of this modern agriculture era as they promote sustainable growth in the agricultural sector. </p>
        <p class="m-3">Machinery and tools invented to reduce human effort. It is evident that all the farmers want to increase their production in the field with minimum effort. These tools and machinery used interchangeably. The considerable knowledge of tools can unlock the chances of success. These agriculture tools used primarily for weed elimination, fertilizer, general tillage, elimination, and fumigation. To take these points in mind, we come up with a list of Farm tools names and tools used in agriculture. Check out below.</p>

                      Traditional ploughing of farms by using iron ploughs and bulls was one of the major professions of farmers in almost all villages in the near past. But the advent of modern ploughing machines has forced the traditional ploughing method into dark.

                      Harvesting: Cut and collect crops such as wheat, rice, oats, barley, corn, soybeans, sunflowers, and pulses.
                      Threshing: Separate the edible grain from the inedible chaff and straw.
                      Winnowing: Remove impurities and excess chaff from the grain, leaving a clean and dry product.</p>

Acaricides, which kill mites and ticks, are not strictly insecticides, but are usually classified together with insecticides. The major use of Insecticides is agriculture, but they are also used in home and garden, industrial buildings, vector control and control of insect parasites of animals and humans. Insecticides are claimed to be a major factor behind the increase in the 20th-century's agricultural productivity.</p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Modern Agricultural Tools</h3>
      <p class="m-3">Modern agricultural tools refers to the involvement of technologies like GPS, sensors, IoT devices to enhance the efficiency of planting, irrigation, harvesting etc.. There are some ancient modern agriculture tools like tractors, cultivators also. In this article, we are focusing more on modern agricultural tools with the involvement of sophisticated methods. Some of the examples are drones, soil sensors, robotic weeders, crop monitoring apps etc…  Before engaging more into the examples of modern agricultural tools , we can first discuss why modern agricultural tools in agriculture</p>

          <img src="./drone.webp" alt="">
          <p>Drones are one of the most important modern agricultural tools. It is an unmanned aerial vehicle that helps in yield optimization, monitoring crop growth and thereby increasing production. 
            Working
            They typically  work as other modes of air transportation, when the engine is turned on ,it starts up and the propellers rotate to enable flight. They are controlled by remote operators.This is one of the important tools used in agriculture.</p>

          <img src="./soil sensor.webp" alt="">
          <p>Soil sensors  are instruments used to measure soil moisture , pH, salinity conductivity , temperature. As  in the process of agricultural cultivation, the soil condition needs to be periodically monitored to improve productivity. This is one of the important used in mordern farming in india by using it the farmer get more benifits on working on the farm fields.Soil sensors are instruments used to measure soil moisture , pH, salinity conductivity.</p>

          <p>Instruments used to measure soil moisture , pH, salinity conductivity , temperature. As  in the process of agricultural cultivation, the soil condition needs to be periodically monitored to improve productivity. Based on the element the sensor measured from the soil, there are 5 types of sensors, namely, soil moisture sensor, soil temperature sensor,  soil conductivity sensor, soil pH sensor, Soil NPK Sensor.The most needed example of modern agriculture tools.
